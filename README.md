# Pricify

The development of the Pricify app began with this vision: to create a responsive, user-friendly interface for procurement specialists to analyze part numbers, lead times, and more importantly pricing data. Leveraging MATLAB’s App Designer framework, a multi-tabbed interface complete with grids, tables, sliders, and buttons has been designed, all meticulously arranged using nested `uigridlayout`. Early iterations focused on ensuring that each UI component not only fit within the layout but also adapted seamlessly to window resizing, providing a polished look and feel from the outset. Custom styling—such as alternating row colors and centered text—was applied to enhance readability, reflecting an early commitment to intuitive user experience.

Once the UI prototype was in place, attention turned to robust data handling capabilities. The app integrated tightly with Excel, using `readtable` and `writetable` calls to pull and push data to “Merged Dataset.xlsx,” a central repository for pricing and supplier information. Through a combination of vectorized table operations and strategic use of `ismissing` checks, the code gracefully handled missing or malformed entries. String-processing routines employing `regexprep` and pattern matching cleansed part numbers, ensuring that search routines operated on standardized input. These steps laid the groundwork for efficient data filtering and aggregation, critical for the project’s core functionality.

With clean data pipelines established, algorithmic features were implemented to support flexible search and analysis workflows. Users could toggle between exact and partial matches when querying part numbers, while slider-driven tolerance ranges allowed dynamic filtering based on quantity thresholds. Statistical routines computed averages, minima, and maxima of key cost metrics, and a `containers.Map` structure kept track of the most frequent supplier sources. Each feature was carefully encapsulated into modular methods—such as `cleanPartNumber` and `formatRow`—promoting code reuse and easing future maintenance. Throughout this phase, performance considerations guided the choice between vectorized operations and straightforward loops, balancing speed and readability.

To ensure a smooth user journey, it has been built in comprehensive feedback and error-handling mechanisms. Progress dialogs announced the status of long-running operations, while `uialert` boxes informed users of invalid inputs or empty search results. The app’s state—such as whether exact search was active—was tracked via UI component properties, ensuring that interactions remained consistent across sessions. When needed, users could export their filtered results to Excel with a single click, seamlessly integrating the app’s analytical power into existing business workflows. This emphasis on interaction design underscored the project’s goal of blending technical sophistication with practical usability.

Finally, the project’s architecture reflected broader software engineering best practices and domain expertise. Written as a MATLAB class complete with properties and methods, the code embraces object-oriented principles, facilitating future enhancements like unit testing or cloud integration. Although version-control practices were implicit, the clean separation of concerns and thorough inline comments hinted at a collaborative, professional development environment. With its focus on supply chain and cost analysis, Pricify emerged not only as a technical achievement in MATLAB GUI development but also as a strategic tool for teams in manufacturing, procurement, and logistics—empowering stakeholders with rapid, data-driven insights.
